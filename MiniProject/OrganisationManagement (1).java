// Create a program that simulates an organization with different types of employees and departments. The program should have the following classes/interfaces:
// Employee - This is an abstract class that has the properties of an employee such as name, age, salary, etc. It should have a constructor that initializes these properties, and getters and setters to access and modify them.
// Department - This is an abstract class that has the properties of a department such as name, budget, etc. It should have a constructor that initializes these properties, and getters and setters to access and modify them. It should also have an interface named "Operation" that has a method named "performOperation" which will be implemented by different department operations such as hiring, firing, budget allocation, etc.
// Manager - This is a derived class of the Employee class. It should have additional properties such as team, department, etc. It should have a constructor that initializes these properties, and getters and setters to access and modify them.
// Developer - This is a derived class of the Employee class. It should have additional properties such as technology, experience, etc. It should have a constructor that initializes these properties, and getters and setters to access and modify them.
// Marketing - This is a derived class of the Department class. It should have additional properties such as campaigns, events, etc. It should have a constructor that initializes these properties, and getters and setters to access and modify them. It should also implement the "Operation" interface with a method implementation of the "performOperation" method that will simulate marketing campaigns and events.
// IT - This is a derived class of the Department class. It should have additional properties such as technology, infrastructure, etc. It should have a constructor that initializes these properties, and getters and setters to access and modify them. It should also implement the "Operation" interface with a method implementation of the "performOperation" method that will simulate IT operations such as hiring, firing, and budget allocation.
// In the main method, create objects of different types of employees and departments, and simulate employee management and department operations by calling the "performOperation" method of the respective department.

// This program simulates an organization with different types of employees and departments. The Employee class is an abstract class that has properties such as name, age, and salary, and getters and setters to access and modify them. The Department class is also an abstract class that has properties such as name, budget, and an "Operation" interface that has a "performOperation" method for different department operations. The Manager class is a derived class of the Employee class that has additional properties such as team and department. The Developer class is also a derived class of the Employee class with additional properties such as technology and experience. The Marketing class is a derived class of the Department class that has additional properties such as campaigns and events, and it implements the "Operation" interface with a method implementation for marketing campaigns and events. The IT class is another derived class of the Department class that has additional properties such as technology and infrastructure, and it implements the "Operation" interface with a method implementation for IT operations such as hiring, firing, and budget allocation.

// In the main method, the program creates objects of different types of employees and departments and simulates employee management and department operations by calling the "performOperation" method of the respective department. This program provides a basic model for an organization with different types of employees and departments, allowing users to manage employee and department operations through a simple interface.
